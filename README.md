# PrivacyFinalProject
This repository contains the code used to analyze the survey data for our team's CSE 598 final project.

The code corresponds to the figures as follows: 

PrivacySurvey.py & EM.py
These conduct the expectation maximization of the data with respect to utilization and comfort scores. (Figure 4)

behaviorChange.py
This generates the multilevel bar charts comparing the different response categories of users based on their exit questions responses. (Figure 5)

userProfilesKnowledge.py
This generates the swarmplots for displaying the relationship between usage categories and participant's percieved knowledge. (Figure 2)

perceptiveness.py
This generates the boxplots which demonstrate how understnading levels relate to the four main categories of identified data types. (Figure 3)

userProfiles.py
This generates the heatmap of the correlation table attempting to relate the different usage types to one another. (Figure 1)
